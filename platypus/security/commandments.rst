The 10 Commandments

Thou shall:
^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Be no human access to hosts
#. Have a full fledged central logging
#. Have SSL/TLS for all connections
#. Apply security patches immediately and harden the OS
#. Validate input and encode output
#. Be no secrets in repositories
#. Love security reviews - they are mandatory
#. Be no dirty hacks - You think its wrong, then it probably is!
#. You think its compromised - Shutdown and Redeploy
#. Do  no crypto yourself!
