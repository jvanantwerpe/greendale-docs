The identity and access management section is concerned with the management of individual principals, their authentication, authorization and privileges within 
or across system and enterprise boundaries.

Project Platypus is at its core a 4 phased approached to tackle the most immediate requirements in terms of identity and access management. On the following pages you'll find 
some documentation about the current state of the project and some details about the phases.

Overview
--------

As already mention earlier Project Platypus consists of four very different phases. Each of which is comprised of its own unique challenges for Team Greendale and our great colleges form i:IT. 
This article provides a general overview on the individual phases set forth in one of our planning workshops.

Why Platypus?
_____________

The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) also known as the duck-billed platypus is a semiaquatic egg-laying mammal endemic to eastern Australia. Its lives on dry land and in as well under water. Under water, where it hunts exclusively, the platypus uses echolocation to find its prey, while having its eyes shut - apart from the dolphin - again a very unique feature. Also it spends about 12 hours each day looking for food.

Platypuses have managed to survive in urban areas, so they obviously have good survival practices and can compete with dogs and foxes. Thats a though one.

It also the only mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth.

All these very unique properties inspired Team Greendale to choose this animal as its mascot 

The Phases
__________

We choose our project phases based on the platypuses living habitats.

* Phase 1 - Tasmania
* Phase 2 - Victoria - current phase
* Phase 3 - New South Wales
* Phase 4 - Queensland
