This page details which applications we are maintaining.

Its very simple. Most of the application previously developed are great tools but will be replaced with regards to our new IAM soultion. However for the time being we will support these, what we call "Legacy" systems for business continuity reasons.

Thats it!

There is no End of Life or Sun Down planed for any of the legacy systems and we can ensure you to let you know once an appropriate replacement is available. For questions an inquiries regarding legacy systems see the information below.



Legacy Application
------------------
What is legacy, for us its something handed down from a predecessor or from the past. It is our history, the foundation of future work and inspiraction for later development. Needless to say we won't continue to invest time and energy in improving as well as adding features.
Its like an old piece of furniture which you take care of. Some defects must be fixed to make it work, polish it every once in a while but not major remodeling.

tl;dr
^^^^^
A legacy service is an application that:

* is **not** OAuth 2.0 compliant;
* is **not** deployed in AWS.

A typical example of an application that follow this definition is the Config Service.

If you have questions regarding any of these applications - let us know.
