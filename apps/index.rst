Its very simple. Most of the application previously developed are great tools but will be replaced with regards to our new IAM soultion. However for the time being we will support these, what we call "Legacy" systems for business continuity reasons.

Thats it!

There is no End of Life or Sun Down planed for any of the legacy systems and we can ensure you to let you know once an appropriate replacement is available. For questions an inquiries regarding legacy systems see the information below.

A legacy service is an application that:

* is **not** OAuth 2.0 compliant;

A typical example of an application that follow this definition is the Config Service.
